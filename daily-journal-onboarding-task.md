## üíª Development Guide

### Backend Development (Flask + SQLite)

**Key Components:**
- **Flask App** (`app.py`) - Main server application
- **Database** (`database.py`) - SQLite database setup and operations
- **Models** (`models.py`) - Data structures for journal entries

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- `GET /api/quote` - Returns daily inspirational quote
- `POST /api/journal` - Saves a new journal entry
- `GET /api/journal` - Returns all journal entries
- `GET /api/journal/<date>` - Returns entries for specific date

### Frontend Development

**Key Files:**
- **HTML** (`index.html`) - Page structure and layout
- **CSS** (`style.css`) - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`) - API calls and user interactions

**Features to Implement:**
- Daily quote display section
- Journal entry form (date, mood, text)
- Past entries display with date filtering
- Simple, clean design

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE journal_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    mood VARCHAR(20),
    entry TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üìù Step-by-Step Plan

## üß™ Testing Your Application

Ensuring your application works as expected is crucial. Testing helps catch bugs early and maintain code quality.

### Types of Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions or components in isolation.
    - **Backend (Python/Flask)**: Use libraries like `pytest` or Python's built-in `unittest` module to test your API endpoints, database functions, and business logic.
    - **Frontend (JavaScript/React)**: Use frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine to test individual UI components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different parts of your application, such as the frontend and backend, or your application and the database.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulate real user scenarios by testing the entire application flow from the user interface to the backend and database. Tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright can be used for E2E testing.Use things of your choice

### Suggested Tools
- **Pytest**: A popular testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write small, readable tests.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. Often used with React.
- **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- **Postman/Insomnia**: Useful for manually testing your API endpoints during development.

### Best Practices for Testing
- Write tests for new features as you develop them.
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical parts of your application.
- Run tests frequently, especially before committing code.
- Keep your tests independent and repeatable.

git add .
git commit -m "Add journal entry form with validation"
git push origin main

# Use branches for features
git checkout -b feature/quote-api
git checkout -b feature/entry-history
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple** - Get basic functionality working before adding features
2. **Test Early** - Test your API endpoints as you build them
3. **Commit Often** - Make small, frequent commits with clear messages
4. **Use AI to refine** - Don't hesitate to use any AI tools of choice to refine your code (stick to free version for now)
5. **Document Everything** - Write clear README and code comments
6. **Plan Your UI** - Sketch your interface before coding
